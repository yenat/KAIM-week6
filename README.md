## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a credit scoring model that classifies users into high risk and low-risk categories. The model uses various feature engineering techniques and RFMS formalism.

## Files

- `EDA_credit_score.ipynb`: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- `feature_engineering.ipynb`: Feature Engineering
- `woe_binning.ipynb`: Weight of Evidence (WoE) Binning

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yenat/KAIM-week6.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd KAIM-week6
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Run the notebook cells in the following order:
   - `EDA_credit_score.ipynb`
   - `feature_engineering.ipynb`
   - `woe_binning.ipynb`
